This is an updated version of a Hexagonal Grid in Xojo. The older version is located at: https://github.com/eugenedakin/HexagonalGridXojo . Rows and columns are numbered in a hexagonal grid when the rows start at zero at the top, and increase as you go near the bottom. Columns start at zero at the left and the value increases as you move to the right. Below is a screen grab of the hexagonal grid. More information is available on my website at:
